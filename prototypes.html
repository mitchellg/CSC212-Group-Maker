            <h1>Need Finding</h1>
            <p>For our project, groupmaker set out to find the stress points of group formation, from the perspective of students and professors, when groups are assigned and self-formed. To find the perspective of students, we designed the following survey:
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/u.rochester.edu/forms/d/107oBLjUGxbY8T9uH5cHl94nUWQ4TkgqXEVFaxafAIqw/edit" target="_blank">Survey</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/u.rochester.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aga0S3Fo7sm_dGg4aHY3S1pYS0ZFVkxieW1DaHExR2c&usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank">Click for Survey Responses</a></p>
            <h3>Quantitative Analysis:</h3>
            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/107oBLjUGxbY8T9uH5cHl94nUWQ4TkgqXEVFaxafAIqw/viewanalytics" target="_blank">Click to view graphical analysis</a></p>
            <h3>Qaulitative Analysis:</h3>
            <h4>Relevancy</h4>
                <p>In total, we had 96 responses. 78% of respondents have had a group project for a class before. This means our product would be relevant to most students. Of that 78%, another 78% were in groups that were assigned by professors, and 22% had only every been in groups that they chose themselves. However, a full 90% had at some point in their schooling been allowed to choose a group of their own.</p>
                <h4>Team Ratings</h4>
                <p>Generally, students found their teams' skills to be just about average, with most rating the skills at 3/5, and almost equal percentages choosing 2 and 4. Students were MORE satisfied with the final product of their assigned groups than with their self-formed groups, with most (45%) respondents giving it a 4/5. This is perhaps why a full majority (52%) of respondents chose 4/5 for their satisfaction with their teams’ distribution of skills.  A similar distribution was found for how students value a team’s diversity of skill/backgrounds for a group.</p>
                <p>A majority (53%) of students found the distribution of work in their groups to be unfair, meaning that some members were carrying the team. On the ease of forming groups, there was a wide variance, but on average, students gave that ease a 4/5.</p>
                <h4>Common Responses</h4>
                <p>At the end of the survey, we left two open-ended questions in hopes of attaining some unique feedback: possibilities that may not have been envisioned by our survey. Amongst the responses to these questions ran some very common themes.</p>
                <p><b>“What are some issues you’ve encountered when a professor assigns groups?”</b></p>
                <p><b>Getting together:</b> “didn’t have time to meet”….”someone always had class”…”difficult to schedule”…</p>
                <p><b>Free-loading:</b>“slackers”….”people who don’t do the work”…”mooching”…”slackers” …”slackers”…”slackers”….”people don’t do fair share”….”slackers”…”slackers”…slackers.”</p>
                <p><b>Lack of Skill:</b>“stuck with people who are not very good at the subject”…”distribution of talents” … “bad combination of skills”</p>
                <p><b>Incompatibility:</b>“figure out who will be the leader, other roles” … “bad synergy” … “not getting along” … “social incompatibility” … “harder to communicate” … “didn’t like some group member” … “being uncomfortable around your teammates” … “end up working with weirdos.”</p>
                <p><b>“What are some issues you've encountered when forming your own groups?”</b></p>
                <p><b>Problems with Friends:</b>“Choosing your friends is not always the smartest move” … “Working with friends is not always efficient” …”if group members are friends…it can be hard to disagree” … “stuck with a friend that didn't do work” … “not wanting to say no” … “not wanting to exclude slacker friend” … “broken friendships & hearts” … “friends taking advantage.”</p>
                <p><b>Being Left Out:</b>“difficult to find students who would like to work with me” … “Students afraid to take me as their partner” … “being excluded from the group” … “finding people” … “hard to find people who have similar idea.”</p>

                <h3>Findings</h3>
                <p>Our analysis found that students generally found the work distribution of their groups to be unfair, and the distribution of skills to be neutral or positive, depending on whether the team is assigned or self-formed, respectively. Students generally view a diversity of skills to be important, and are generally satisfied with the outcomes of their projects.</p>
                <p>Our open-ended questions led to some more interesting findings. When assigned to groups, students find issues with getting together for meetings, team members lacking the necessary skills, free-loaders, and incompatibility. When groups are self-formed, students find issues with potentially being left out (and people not recognizing their value as a team member), as well as issues with including and excluding friends who might be bad for your group.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Groupmaker’s algorithm and options need to incorporate these different facets of group formation. We need to assure that teams have evenly distributed skills, and that every member is contributing positively. In the short term, it may be too difficult to incorporate issues like timing and social incompatibility, but there is definitely room to grow in these areas for the future.</p>
